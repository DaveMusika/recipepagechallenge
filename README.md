## Overview
The challenge was to build a recipe page and make it look as close to the designs provided as possible. The designs were for both desktop ![](design/desktop-design.jpg)
and mobile ![](design/mobile-design.jpg).

### Screenshot

And here is my solution for the desktop ![](./desktopscreenshot.png) and mobile ![](./mobilescreenshot.png)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I had a lot of things to learn in this project. For example, the use of section tag, span tag, creating styles within heading tags, making use of classes which I later used in CSS to deccorate specific html elements.


### Continued development

I want to learn more about the proper use of html elements and tags. The way I used them, it reached a time and they became so overwhelming, especially when it came to the part of styling either from the external CSS file or within the html itself. Its a mess, but gives me hope that I can do better.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://w3schools.com) - I used it for the majority of the work such as how classes are created and how to use the style element within tags.
- [Example resource 2](https://https://paletadecolores.online/en/html-colors/brown/wenge/) - I stambled on this website trying to figure out how the wenge brown color looks like and instead i ended up using it as an example to learn how they created the white background. I accessed the html and css code they used using the devtools.



## Acknowledgments

I took on this challenge after two weeks of trying to learn html and css on a daily basis. I needed something that would make me feel like the hours am putting in to learn aint in vain. Therefore, I am acknowledging MYSELF and the effort and resilience I am putting in to learn and be a good front-end web developer. I also acknowledge [](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/) for creating this platform to help us, aspiring developers, to grow the confidence coding.
